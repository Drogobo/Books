# FAKE LANGUAGE

## Features
- Subject-Verb-Object word order to split the sentence easily
- Speech-friendly phonetic inventory
- Always one word order
- No irregularities
- Simple relative clauses that close themselves when they end
- No cases
- Verbs always seperate subject and object (if there is one)
- Nothing else can end like a verb
- Prepositions will always go at the end of a sentence unless they are in a clause
- There is only one word for dependent clauses
- There can only be a voiced or unvoiced consonant of a certain type, never both

## Phonemes
- The inventory is optimized for speech disability compatibility.

- Syllables will always have a CV(n) or CVV(n) structure.
- The one diphthong is ae (/ɑɛ/)

## Sentence structure
- The word order stays consistent no matter what
- Any noun/adjective/verb can be turned into a noun/adjective/verb by changing the placement in the sentence
- Function words are always one syllable (this includes linking verbs)
- That does not mean that every one syllable word is a function word, though
- Stress is always on the first syllable of each word
- Context can be used instead of words to save time or energy
